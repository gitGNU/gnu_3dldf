Get rid of creatnew.web.  Just use 'new' instead.

LDF 2013.06.03.

Put scanner and parser files into a separate library.

Change the way the rule for generating ctangle output work, so that the .c files are
renamed immediately.  This should prevent `make' from getting confused and trying to
compile them with `gcc'.
