To install 3DLDF, decompress 3DLDF-1.2.0.tar.gz using gzip, or a
compatible program, e.g., 
`gunzip 3DLDF-1.2.0.tar.gz'.
Then, expand 3DLDF-1.2.0.tar using the tar command, typically:
`tar xvpf 3DLDF-1.2.0.tar'
The exact syntax of the tar command may differ, depending on what
system you're using.

3DLDF unpacks into the directory /3DLDF-1.2.0/.  

Change your working directory to /3DLDF-1.2.0/ and run 
`configure --prefix=<your path>/3DLDF-1.2.0/' 
to generate the Makefiles.  There is one each in /3DLDF-1.2.0/, 
/3DLDF-1.2.0/CWEB, /3DLDF-1.2.0/DOC, and /3DLDF-1.2.0/DOC/TEXINFO.  
`<your path>' must be the absolute path of the directory where you
want to put the /3DLDF-1.2.0/ subdirectory. For example, if you want
to put 3DLDF into /usr/local/mydirectory/, enter
 `configure --prefix=/usr/local/mydirectory/3DLDF-1.2.0/' 

Since 3DLDF currently does not have an input routine, the executable
3dldf will need to be regenerated each time the user code changes.
For this reason, it might as well reside in the same directory as the
C++ source files.  However, it can be put in 
another directory, e.g., /usr/local/bin/, if desired.  In this case,
`configure' can be called with a different `prefix' argument, or the
default (/usr/local/bin/) can be used.

Change the working directory to /3DLDF-1.2.0/ and 
call `make install' from the command line of a shell.
This creates the executable file `3dldf'.

For information on running 3dldf, see the README file in this directory, and
the _3DLDF User and Reference Manual_, which is included in this
distribution as the PostScript file /3DLDF-1.2.0/DOC/TEXINFO/3DLDF.ps.
