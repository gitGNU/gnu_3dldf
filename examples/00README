LDF 2013.11.07.

This directory (`[...]/3DLDF-2.0/examples/') contains examples of how to use 3dldf 
together with MetaPost, TeX, dvips and ps2pdf to generate three-dimensional graphics.

The distribution includes the generated PostScript and PDF files, so neither 3dldf 
nor any of the other packages have to be installed in order to generate them.  

In order to prevent them from being generated, the `Makefile.am' does not contain rules
for doing this.  Instead, it contains the rule `rebuild', which calls `make' recursively
with the filename `Makefile_sub' as the argument to the `-f' option, i.e.,

   make -f Makefile_sub

The latter file contains rules for creating (or re-creating) the various generated files
by invoking 3dldf, MetaPost, TeX, etc.

Please see the files `Makefile.am' and `Makefile_sub' for more information.
